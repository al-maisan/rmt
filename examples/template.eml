This is an example email template. Everything in this template
will be part of the email body that is sent to the recipients.

When writing the template you may reference any optional / extra data
items specified for the recipients in the configuration file.

*Please note*: if you use an extra data item in the template it must be
defined for *every* recipient.

In addition to per-recipient extra data items specified by you
there are also the following "automatic" data items generated by rmt:

   - _FN: first name
   - _LN: last name(s)
   - _EA: email address
   - _TN: the name of this tool
   - _TV: the version of the tool you are using

Please note how these "automatic" data items all start with an
underscore.

Now for an actual example:

<------------> snip <------> snap <--------------------->

Dear _FN,

how are you? We are writing to let you know that %ORG% is tightening
the security policies for people in your position (%TITLE%).

Please let us know if %_EA% is not the proper email address to send this
message to.

Thank you!
